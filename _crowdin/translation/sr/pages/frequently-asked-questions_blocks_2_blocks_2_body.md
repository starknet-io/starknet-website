[Cairo](https://medium.com/starkware/hello-cairo-3cb43b13b209) is a Turing-complete language designed for succinctly proving the correct execution of Cairo programs. A Cairo program is stateless, meaning you do not have native access to storage, other Cairo programs, or the L1 state (although you can access those, as explained below).Â 

Starknet contracts, on the other hand, live in the Starknet VM, which has a persistent state that smart contracts can access and modify. These smart contracts can store variables, communicate with other contracts, and send/receive messages to/from L1 ([read more](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html)).
