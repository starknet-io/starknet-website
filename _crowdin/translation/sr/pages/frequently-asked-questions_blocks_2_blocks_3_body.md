No. You have several options for writing a contract, each with its own benefits.Â 

Cairo is the native language for a Starknet contract, which most fully realizes the scaling potential of Starknet. On the other hand, several teams are developing transpilers from other programming languages (notably Solidity) to Cairo. Such transpilers facilitate quick deployment of existing contracts on Starknet.**[See our latest development tooling](/developers/tools-resources).**
