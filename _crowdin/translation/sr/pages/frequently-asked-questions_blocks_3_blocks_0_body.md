Starknet is evolving to become fully permissionless, allowing anyone to operate on the network:

1. **Sequencers**  – Anyone will be able to operate a sequencer, i.e., batch transactions and propose new blocks (somewhat analogous to Ethereum miners, without the Proof of Work part).
2. **Provers** – Anyone will be able to set up a prover and create proofs for the validity of new blocks.
3. **Developers** – Developers will be able to deploy their smart contracts – permissionlessly.
4. **Users** – Users will be able to send transactions permissionlessly. As the system will be decentralized, the possibility of censorship will be eliminated.
