The decentralization of the network has two aspects:

1. The permissionless layer of Sequencers and Provers ensures that the network will be censorship-resistant.
2. The usage of STARK-proofs ensures that the state is correct, allows everyone to verify the entire Starknet chain with low hardware requirements – regardless of the network’s throughput, and without trusting any external entity.
