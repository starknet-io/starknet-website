In line with our goal to make the Starknet community accessible and usable to as many people across the globe as possible, we’ve listed a collection of non-English resources below.\
\
These are places where you can discover and discuss all things Starknet with other community members in your native language and/or based on where you live in the world. \
\
If there’s a resource in a non-English language that you’re aware of and don’t see listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-website/issues) on Github to get it added.
