Weâ€™ve previously proposed a [plan](https://medium.com/starkware/part-3-starknet-token-design-5cc17af066c6) for initial allocation of the tokens. Tokens allocated to shareholders, employees, and independent software developers are locked for four years, with a gradual release schedule starting after one-year. Locked tokens can be used for voting and staking, but cannot be transferred or traded. Some of the tokens are locked via a dedicated smart contract on Ethereum while other tokens are locked via custodians.
