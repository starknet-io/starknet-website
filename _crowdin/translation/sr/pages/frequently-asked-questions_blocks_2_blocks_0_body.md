Cairo is an overloaded term which stands for three different things. First, Cairo is a CPU architecture. Second, “Cairo” is shorthand for CPU AIR which is an algebraic representation of this CPU architecture. Lastly, Cairo is a Turing complete programming language that enables blockchain developers to harness the power of STARKs. The first two aspects, alongside the instruction set of the language, are outlined in the [whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1063). For the language, see the [github repo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo).
