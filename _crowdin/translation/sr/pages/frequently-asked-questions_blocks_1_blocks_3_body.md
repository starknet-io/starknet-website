SHARP (shared prover) is a service for computing proofs of the correct execution of Cairo programs. It can be used to prove the correct execution of a particular Cairo program which enforces the validity of Starknet state transitions â€“ the Starknet OS (operating system). Currently, Starknet uses SHARP alongside many other customers to amortize proof costs. In the future, Starknet throughput may justify a dedicated prover layer..
