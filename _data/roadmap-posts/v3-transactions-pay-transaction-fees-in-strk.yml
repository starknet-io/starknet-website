      T﻿his version introduces the following changes:


      In addition to ETH, users will be able to pay transaction fees in STRK using the new transaction type – transaction v3.


      In addition to fee payment in STRK, v3 transactions are structured to support several upcoming features detailed below.


      > **I﻿MPORTANT** While V3 transactions will support the following features, not all the features that they will support will be available in Starknet V0.13.0.


      * A **fee market**, starting with Starknet v0.14.0, to enable users to optimize their transaction process by the network during periods of congestion.

      * A **paymaster** mechanism, to enable entities other than the transaction sender to pay transaction fees.

      * Account deployment will take place with an account’s initial Invoke or Declare transaction.

      * **Volition mode**, for reducing data availability costs.

      * **Nonce generalization**, enabling users to send multiple transactions simultaneously by specifying different channels for different transactions.
