      Starknet is improving the overall network stability with a series of
      enhancements of our infrastructure. 


      We are making progress in improving the synchronization of components and eliminating bottlenecks we found, ensuring their efficient operation.


      We’re also investing in more rigorous stress-testing scenarios, to ensure our system can handle unexpected surges.
