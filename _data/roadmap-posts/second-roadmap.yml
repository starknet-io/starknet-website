      Developed using the Rust programming language, the Rust-based Cairo VM
      provides an efficient and optimized environment for executing Cairo
      contracts within the Starknet ecosystem.


      This introduction of the Rust-based Cairo VM represents a significant milestone in Starknet's development. It signifies a transition from the previous implementation to leverage the performance benefits and robustness offered by Rust.


      By incorporating the Rust-based Cairo VM, Starknet ensures a seamless and predictable experience for users and developers. The VM's efficiency and optimization result in reduced contract execution times and improved overall performance. This advancement lays the groundwork for future scalability and reliability enhancements, enabling Starknet to handle increased usage and maintain its commitment to efficient contract execution and application development.
