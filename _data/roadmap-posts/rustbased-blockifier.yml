      The Rust-based Blockifier is a crucial component of Starknet's upcoming
      version, v0.12.0. It significantly improves throughput and latency by
      reducing block execution time.


      Developed by StarkWare as an open-source project, the Rust-based Blockifier utilizes the Rust programming language to implement an optimized block processing mechanism.


      This introduction marks a significant milestone in Starknet's development, as it involves transitioning to the Rust-based Blockifier from the previous python-based implementation. This shift leverages the performance and reliability advantages offered by Rust.


      By implementing the Rust-based Blockifier, Starknet ensures reduced waiting times and improves transaction latency during everyday network conditions. Moreover, it establishes a foundation for future scalability and performance enhancements, allowing Starknet to handle increased traffic efficiently and reliably as the platform continues to grow.
