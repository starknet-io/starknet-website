      As part of its roadmap, Starknet aims to significantly reduce transaction
      costs by introducing Volition mode.Â 


      Currently, L1 (Ethereum) data cost accounts for the majority (95%) of transaction costs on Starknet. To address this, Volition mode will enable developers to build applications with a hybrid Data Availability (DA) approach, incorporating both onchain and offchain data.


      By leveraging Volition mode, Starknet anticipates a reduction in the cost of L1 data.


      The specifics of Volition's design and developer interfaces will be shared soon.
