      As part of its roadmap, Starknet aims to significantly reduce transaction
      costs by introducing Volition mode. Currently, L1 (Ethereum) data cost
      accounts for the majority (95%) of transaction costs on Starknet. To
      address this, Volition mode will enable developers to build applications
      with a hybrid Data Availability (DA) approach, incorporating both on-chain
      and off-chain data.


      By leveraging Volition mode, Starknet anticipates a dramatic reduction in the cost of data. 




      **This reduction is expected to be achieved through two key factors:** 


      * The implementation of Ethereum's EIP-4844 (Shard Blob Transaction)

      * The introduction of Volition itself. 


      Volition will be officially released only once EIP-4844 has been deployed to the Ethereum mainnet.


      The specifics of Volition's design and developer interfaces will be shared soon, providing further details on how it will contribute to lowering transaction costs.
