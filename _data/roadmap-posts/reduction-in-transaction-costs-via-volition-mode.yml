      As part of its roadmap for 2023, Starknet aims to significantly reduce
      transaction costs by introducing Volition mode. Currently, L1 (Ethereum)
      data cost accounts for the majority (95%) of transaction costs on
      Starknet. To address this, Volition mode will enable developers to build
      applications with a hybrid Data Availability (DA) approach, incorporating
      both on-chain and off-chain data.


      By leveraging Volition mode, Starknet anticipates a dramatic reduction in the cost of data. This reduction is expected to be achieved through two key factors: the implementation of Ethereum's EIP-4844 (Shard Blob Transaction) and the introduction of Volition itself. The specifics of Volition's design and developer interfaces will be shared soon, providing further details on how it will contribute to lowering transaction costs.
