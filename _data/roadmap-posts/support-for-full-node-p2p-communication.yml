      I﻿n Starknet version 0.12.2 we are introducing a new endpoint to the
      Starknet feeder gateway which will return the *`state_diff_commitment,
      block_hash`* and the signature on
      the *`state_diff_commitment+block_hash`* value. 


      T﻿his change will make it possible for full nodes to implement P2P communication. 


      We are also making further optimizations to the stack which will result in another increase in throughput and performance.
