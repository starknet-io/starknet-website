      I﻿n Starknet version 0.12.2 we are introducing a new endpoint to the
      Starknet feeder gateway which will return the *`state_diff_commitment,
      block_hash`* and the signature on
      the *`state_diff_commitment+block_hash`* value. T﻿his change will
      facilitate full node P2P communication.   


      We are also making further optimizations to the stack which will result in another increase in throughput and performance.
