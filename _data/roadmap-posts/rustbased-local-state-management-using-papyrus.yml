      Papyrus, an open-source Rust implementation of a Starknet full node, revolutionizes local state management. It enhances performance and decentralization, paving the way for mass adoption of Starknet.


      In the upcoming 0.12.0 release, Papyrus will be integrated into Starknet's infrastructure. With efficient and reliable local storage mechanisms, Papyrus surpasses previous implementations. It optimizes the Sequencer by utilizing a local database and a flat key/value storage structure, eliminating the need for complex paths.


      Papyrus strengthens the ecosystem, adding decentralization and redundancy. It enables communication and synchronization among nodes, improving efficiency and sync times.
