      The Rust-based local state management system is a fundamental component of
      Starknet's infrastructure. It plays a crucial role in handling and
      managing the state of contracts within the network.


      Developed using the Rust programming language, the Rust-based local state management system provides an efficient and reliable mechanism for storing and accessing contract state data locally.


      The introduction of the Rust-based local state management system marks a significant milestone in Starknet's development. It represents a shift from the previous implementation and harnesses the performance benefits and robustness offered by Rust.


      By integrating the Rust-based local state management system, Starknet ensures a seamless and predictable experience for users and developers. The system's efficiency and reliability result in improved contract state handling and faster access times. This advancement establishes a solid foundation for future scalability and performance enhancements, empowering Starknet to handle increased usage and maintain efficient and secure state management for contracts within the network.
