    body: "Tester: In the roadmap for Starknet in 2023, one of the key areas of
      development is the introduction of a fee market to improve user experience
      during network congestion. Currently, when congestion occurs, waiting
      times for transactions increase for everyone. To address this issue,
      Starknet plans to introduce a fee market in version 0.14.0. This fee
      market will allow for an efficient allocation of Starknet's limited
      resources based on users' willingness to pay for a transaction, rather
      than simply following the order of transactions in line. By implementing a
      fee market, Starknet aims to provide a more predictable and seamless
      experience for users, even during periods of high network activity.r"
