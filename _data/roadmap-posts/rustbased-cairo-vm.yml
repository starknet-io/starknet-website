      **E﻿stimation:** July 2023 on testnet.


      Developed by LambdaClass using the Rust programming language, the Rust-based Cairo Virtual Machine (VM) provides an efficient and optimized environment for executing Cairo contracts within the Starknet ecosystem.


      The VM's efficiency and optimization result in reduced contract execution times, higher throughput, lower latency and improved overall performance. 


      This advancement lays the groundwork for future scalability and reliability enhancements, enabling Starknet to handle increased usage and maintain its commitment to efficient contract execution.
