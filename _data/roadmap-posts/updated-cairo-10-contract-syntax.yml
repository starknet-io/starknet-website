      Starknet contracts are being improved with the added support from the
      latest addition to Cairo 1 syntax. These enhancements aim to improve
      safety and extensibility, particularly in contract interface, storage
      declaration, and event structure. By introducing these changes, developers
      can create more natural and secure smart contracts on Starknet.


      The new syntax will be incorporated into the next version of Cairo, making it available on Starknet v0.12.0. Developers will have a six-month period to migrate to the new syntax, primarily impacting the outer layer of the contract. This transition is designed to be straightforward, and collaborative efforts with Cairo 1 auditors ensure a smooth re-auditing process.


      While Starknet continues to support Cairo 0 until the 'regenesis' event later this year, the introduction of the new syntax aligns Cairo 1 with modern practices and Rust-like patterns. By enhancing contract interface, storage declaration, and event structure, the new syntax improves extensibility, safety, and clarity in contract behavior.


      Developers are empowered to easily build large, interacting projects while minimizing bugs and promoting explicit contract behavior with the new syntax. It provides a foundation for creating robust and scalable smart contracts on Starknet.
