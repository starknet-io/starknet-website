    body: In the roadmap for Starknet, one of the key areas of development is the
      introduction of a fee market to improve user experience during network
      congestion. Currently, when congestion occurs, waiting times for
      transactions increase for everyone. To address this issue, Starknet plans
      to introduce a fee market in version 0.14.0, which will enable users to
      accelerate their transaction's finality time by applying a fee market.
      This will provide users with a predictable and seamless experience,
      including during periods of high network activity.
