    body: In the roadmap for Starknet in 2023, one of the key areas of development
      is the introduction of a fee market to improve user experience during
      network congestion. Currently, when congestion occurs, waiting times for
      transactions increase for everyone. To address this issue, Starknet plans
      to introduce a fee market in version 0.14.0. This fee market will allow
      for an efficient allocation of Starknet's limited resources based on
      users' willingness to pay for a transaction, rather than simply following
      the order of transactions in line. By implementing a fee market, Starknet
      aims to provide a more predictable and seamless experience for users, even
      during periods of high network activity.
