      In the roadmap for Starknet, one of the key areas of development is the
      introduction of a fee market to improve user experience during network
      congestion. Currently, when congestion occurs, waiting times for
      transactions increase for everyone. To address this issue, Starknet plans
      to introduce a fee market in version 0.14.0. 


      This fee market will allow for an efficient allocation of Starknet's limited resources based on users' willingness to pay for a transaction, rather than simply following the order of transactions in the queue. By implementing a fee market, Starknet aims to provide a more predictable and seamless experience for users, even during periods of high network activity.
