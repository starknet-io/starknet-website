        description: "Volition presents a design proposal aimed at reducing L1 data
          availability costs, which currently account for over 90% of the
          average transaction cost on Starknet. This proposal offers developers
          and users the choice to select from various data availability
          solutions. During this workshop, we will delve into the challenges and
          associated risks. Our objective is to brainstorm potential design
          modifications that can address these issues effectively. For further
