      description: >-
        A gathering in Tel Aviv is exploring the way to scale Ethereum
        through Layer 2 blockchains. Ash Bennington and Marco Olivera are joined
        live by StarkWare co-founder and president Eli Ben-Sasson and Argent CEO
        and co-founder Itamar Lesuisse to discuss an announcement that StarkWare
        will make its STARK Prover software open source. In other news: FTX
        wants the money Sam Bankman-Fried donated to politicians back, Binance
        launched a crypto tax tool in France and Canada, South Korea is moving
        ahead with regulating security tokens, and a mysterious image is popping
        up on the Twitter accounts of multiple DeFi platforms.
