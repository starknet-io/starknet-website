short_desc: We are in the midst of a Cambrian Explosion in the field of cryptographic proofs of computational integrity (CI). While a couple of years ago there were about 1–3 new systems a year, the rate has picked up so much that today we are seeing this same amount monthly, if not weekly. In this STARK @ Home talk, Eli Ben-Sasson suggests a method to better categorize and understand the different systems.
