          StarkNet is up and running on Mainnet. But is it EVM compatible? Can
          you deploy your Solidity contract on StarkNet? The answer is Yes, with
          Warp.


          Warp is a Solidity to Cairo transpiler, developed by the Nethermind team. It takes Solidity contracts, translates them into Cairo, and deploys them to StarkNet.


          Solidity apps can easily test the water over StarkNet, with Warp shortening your time-to-market.


          But how do you transpile a Solidity contract into Cairo? What are the challenges? How were they solved?


          In this STARK @ Home episode, Greg Vardy – head of Nethermind’s Warp team, and Jorik Schellekens from the Warp team – will share their team’s experience and insights.
