          On this Episode I met up with Motty the CEO and founder of Braavos
          wallet, after meeting him in Paris this summer we did a brief catch up
          of all the happenings at Braavos. He also explained me the newest
          feature the Hardware signer!

          Braavos #Wallet is a #smartcontract based wallet running on #StarkNet, a ZK roll-up on top of #Ethereum (#layer2). By making a self-custodial wallet, Braavos is making sure decentralization and self-custodianship are easy to use, while still maintaining all benefits associated with decentralization.
