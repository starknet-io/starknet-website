        title: The Musical Possibilities of Starknet | Casey Wescott
        description: My talk presents generative music libraries on Starknet and
          explores their integration with games and applications. I will share
          how music is being used in games on Starknet such as Loot
          Realms/Survivor, Cartridge’s RYO and my collaboration with Topology on
          the music game MuMu. Tools are demonstrated, played and used to
          compose ever-varying music. Music models' capability to adjust to
          changing player dynamics is outlined. Beyond gaming, musical
          applications in collaborative contexts are discussed, underscoring the
          potential of generative music in enhancing user experiences across
          diverse applications on Starknet.
