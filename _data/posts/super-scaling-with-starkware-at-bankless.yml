        title: Super Scaling with StarkWare
        description: >-
          Ethereum is scaling. With a recent $50 million raise at a valuation of
          $2 billion, StarkWare is pioneering zkRollups across the Ethereum
          ecosystem. As it powers dYdX, arguably the most liquid market in the
          world, StarkWare is continuing to move into new territory, with
          StarkNet imminently deploying on Ethereum Mainnet.


          The goal of StarkWare is simple: 'bring massive scalability to Ethereum while preserving L1 security, permissionless interactions, and decentralization.' 


          The ecosystem is growing at an astounding rate, so tune in as core members Uri Kolodny and Eli Ben-Sasson walk us through how StarkWare is bringing Super Scaling to Ethereum.
