      Introduction


      On 9 November 2023, the Starknet Foundation announced the [appointment of its DeFi Committee](https://www.starknet.io/en/content/defi-committee-launch-advancing-starknets-defi-progress) tasked with the mandate of growing DeFi on Starknet. 


      After two months of internal and external research, the Starknet Foundation is excited to announce the launch of a tailored program designed to meet these goals.


      In connection with [OpenBlock Labs](https://www.openblocklabs.com/), the Starknet Foundation is excited to announce the launch of Starknet DeFi Spring – a six to eight month program where 40M STRK will be distributed to participating DeFi protocols on Starknet.  


      This is the first in a series of next steps by the DeFi Committee towards scaling DeFi on Starknet. This first program focuses on liquidity provisioning.


      ## Part I: STRK Distribution 


      The DeFi Committee plans to distribute 40M STRK tokens every two weeks across six to eight months to participating DeFi protocols on Starknet. An additional 10M STRK (at least) has been reserved for future programs that focus on volume, transactions, grants, incubation programs and more!


      To execute on this plan, the Starknet Foundation has partnered with [OpenBlock Labs](https://www.openblocklabs.com/) to design a program for the fair & equitable distribution of STRK tokens to participating DeFi protocols.


      ### How protocols will get STRK


      Protocol distributions are determined and distributed every two weeks.  At the end of each period, allocations will be made based on a review of the network’s activity and the participating protocol’s compliance and performance.  The allocation is dynamic and allows continuous adjustment based on performance metrics, ensuring alignment with the evolving needs and contributions of protocols within the ecosystem.  


      This program is expected to last until October 2024 with eligible protocols across DEXs and the broader DeFi ecosystem.  


      A list of participating protocols can be found [here](https://starknet.notion.site/Public-DeFi-Spring-Participating-Protocols-8df40d18b4a6483b9126c294308a41eb?pvs=4). 


      ### How users will get STRK


      Using these distributions, each participating protocol will design, announce and execute an incentive program to reward participating users on their platform with their allocation of STRK.  


      Participating protocols will distribute all the STRK they receive to their users.  Each protocol will be responsible for their own distribution of STRK and may have different programs for how and which users will be able to earn STRK. 


      The first round of participating protocols will begin their programs on 22 February 2024, with users being able to claim their allocation of incentives from the protocols by 7 March 2024. 


      For details on how to participate, follow specific communications from each participating protocol. 


      A list of participating protocols can be found [here](https://starknet.notion.site/Public-DeFi-Spring-Participating-Protocols-8df40d18b4a6483b9126c294308a41eb?pvs=4). 


      ## Part II: Quests


      [![alt](/assets/unnamed.png)](https://www.intract.io/starknet)


      To celebrate the start of Starknet DeFi Spring, the Starknet Foundation is launching a Quests campaign with [Intract](https://www.intract.io/) in order to welcome new users into Starknet’s growing DeFi ecosystem!


      Quests are on-chain tasks that users can complete.  A new quest will be released every second day up until 22 March 2024.  


      In total, there will be 15 quests that users will be able to complete and earn experience points (XP) for doing so.  


      To award users that complete these tasks, the Starknet Foundation has worked with [IMCMPLX](https://twitter.com/trueIMCMPLX), the creative artist behind [0n1Force](https://twitter.com/trueIMCMPLX), to design four unique artworks as an NFT reward for users as a proof of completion.


      These will be the only rewards tied directly to the completion of Quests.  


      However, Quests will be live during Starknet DeFi Spring and will include participating protocols that have live incentive programs.  By completing Quests, users may be able to earn STRK through the independent programs run by participating DeFi Protocols. 


      ## Part III: What’s to come? 


      The DeFi Committee has reserved at least another10M STRK in its budget for new initiatives later in Q2 or Q3 of 2024.  It is currently considering programs such as DeFi hackathons, new project grant programs and short term incentive programs.  Stay tuned for more updates! 


      ## FAQ
