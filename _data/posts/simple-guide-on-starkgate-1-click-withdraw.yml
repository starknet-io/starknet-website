      Confirm the transaction on the Argent wallet. It will deposit the tokens in the Starkgate bridge and a small ETH fee to the one-click service provider.


      Once the transaction is confirmed, you can check the status of your transaction on **[Starkscan](https://starkscan.co/)** or **[Voyager](https://voyager.online/).**
