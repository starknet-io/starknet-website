        description: Juno is a robust Starknet client built to seamlessly integrate into
          demanding production deployments, casual setups, and everything in
          between. Backed by fine-tuned optimizations and rigorous testing, Juno
          is prepared to lead the way on Starknet's path to decentralization.
          This talk highlights the design decisions behind Juno's performance
          and stability, and discusses how those features benefit Starknet
          users.
