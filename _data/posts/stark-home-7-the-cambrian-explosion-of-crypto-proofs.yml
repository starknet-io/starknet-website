short_desc: We are in the midst of a Cambrian Explosion in the field of
  cryptographic proofs of computational integrity (CI). While a couple of years
  ago there were about 1–3 new systems a year, the rate has picked up so much
  that today we are seeing this same amount monthly, if not weekly. In this
  STARK @ Home talk, Eli Ben-Sasson suggests a method to better categorize and
  understand the different systems.
