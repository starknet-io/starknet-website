        description: We are in the midst of a Cambrian Explosion in the field of
          cryptographic proofs of computational integrity (CI). While a couple
          of years ago there were about 1–3 new systems a year, the rate has
          picked up so much that today we are seeing this same amount monthly,
          if not weekly. In this STARK @ Home talk, Eli Ben-Sasson suggests a
          method to better categorize and understand the different systems.
