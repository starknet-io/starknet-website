  How do layer-2 environments scale blockchains, and what use cases
  are unlocked by reaching global scale? In this SmartCon 2022 presentation, Gai
  Ron, product manager and blockchain researcher at StarkWare, explores the
  limitations of layer-1 dApps, the advantages of layer-2-native dApps, and the
  path forward for StarkNet.

As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.
