        description: >-
          A gathering in Tel Aviv is exploring the way to scale Ethereum
          through Layer 2 blockchains. Ash Bennington and Marco Olivera are
          joined live by StarkWare co-founder and president Eli Ben-Sasson and
          Argent CEO and co-founder Itamar Lesuisse to discuss an announcement
          that StarkWare will make its STARK Prover software open source. In
          other news: FTX wants the money Sam Bankman-Fried donated to
          politicians back, Binance launched a crypto tax tool in France and
          Canada, South Korea is moving ahead with regulating security tokens,
          and a mysterious image is popping up on the Twitter accounts of
          multiple DeFi platforms.
