        Braavos #Wallet is a #smartcontract based wallet running on #StarkNet, a ZK roll-up on top of #Ethereum (#layer2). By making a self-custodial wallet, Braavos is making sure decentralization and self-custodianship are easy to use, while still maintaining all benefits associated with decentralization.
