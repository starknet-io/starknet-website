short_desc: "In this SmartCon presentation and live demo, StarkWare’s Tom Brand
  and Alon Shtaierman introduce Starknet—a decentralized and permissionless
  ZK-Rollup—that allows smart contract developers to deploy contracts for
  arbitrary computation in a permissionless manner as well as send transactions
  to the network. "
