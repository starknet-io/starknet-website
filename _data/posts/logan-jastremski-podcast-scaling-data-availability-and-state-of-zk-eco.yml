          Squads Protocol: the multisig standard you were looking for on Solana

          Securely manage your treasury, program upgrades and tokens with your Squad.


          - Multi-signature - A multisig requires multiple digital signatures in order to approve transactions. This is opposed to individual web3 wallets, which only require one signature.


          - Security - Multisigs spread the attack vector necessary for your assets to be compromised. By requiring confirmations from multiple private keys, a single point of failure is eliminated.


          - Collective Ownership - Multisigs allow teams to own and manage their on-chain assets together. You get to choose who is on your multisig.


          - Self-Custody -  Your on-chain assets are always in your team’s control. By securing them in a multisig, you forego the risk of centralized entities losing your funds.

          ___


          Orca is a Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM, for short).


          - Orca is the easiest place to trade crypto and build applications on Solana.


          - On Orca, you can trade tokens lightning fast and confidently (thanks to our Fair Price Indicator). Additionally, you can provide liquidity to our concentrated liquidity pools (Whirlpools) to earn trading fees and token emissions.
