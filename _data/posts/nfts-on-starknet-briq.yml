          Briq is an NFT building protocol that allows users to build NFTs out
          of tiny cubes stored on the blockchain called briqs. You can
          disassemble anything built out of briqs to get them back and build
          something else. It’s a vessel for creativity where anyone can express
          themselves in a playful and decentralized way.
