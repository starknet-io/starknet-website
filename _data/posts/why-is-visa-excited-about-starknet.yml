        title: Visa Explores Crypto Auto-payments on Ethereum + Binance, BlockFi Updates
        description: >-
          Visa has signaled its long-term bullishness on the potential of the
          Ethereum blockchain with a paper that explores how to make
          auto-payments possible for self-custody wallets with StarkNet, a Layer
          2 blockchain built on top of Ethereum. Jeremy Varlow and Ash
          Bennington speak with StarkWare president and co-founder Eli
          Ben-Sasson about the solution. Plus, Jeremy and Ash discuss Binance.US
          buying Voyager Digital assets, Reuters looking into Binance’s
          finances, BlockFi hoping to resume some customer withdrawals, and why
          a Genesis bankruptcy would bring an immediate cost to its parent
          company Digital Currency Group. We’ll also hear from WendyO, host of
          The O Show, on the power of self-sovereignty and why NFTs can
          revolutionize music.


          We want to hear from you - send us your questions, comments, and suggestions!
