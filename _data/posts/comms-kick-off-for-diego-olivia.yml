      The Starknet Foundation has appointed Diego Oliva as its first Chief Executive Officer to lead Starknet’s ecosystem and network growth and enhance its decentralisation efforts.


      Oliva served as Facebook's regional director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa from 2009 to 2015, where he led the creation of teams from scratch and played a pivotal role in driving Facebook's exponential growth across the region. He also co-founded and led Glue Home, an IOT company that enables smart access and last-mile in-home deliveries, and served on the board of Just Eat.


      “I am thrilled to join Starknet to actively contribute to scaling blockchain technology and shaping a future that prioritises transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency,” said Oliva. 


      Oliva is a strong believer in the power of blockchain to help a very wide demographic. He commented: “I often think about what this technology can do for the likes of migrants from Mexico, where I was born and raised. As they laboured hard in 2022 to send home almost $60 billion in money transfers, they paid some $3 billion in unnecessarily high wire transfer fees. Scalable and user-friendly blockchain solutions, like those being built on Starknet, can be transformative for such people.” 


      “By leveraging blockchain technology in social networks, gaming platforms, and other domains, individuals can regain control over their personal data, ensure privacy and security, and have a say in how their data is utilised and monetised. It also provides a robust foundation for establishing trust and authenticity in the rapidly evolving world of AI-generated content.”


      “Additionally, the decentralised nature of blockchain systems empowers individuals by spreading decision-making power and the value being created. This promotes a more democratic society where trust is built among participants, reducing the need for middlemen and fostering collaboration.”


      “STARK Proofs, the cryptography behind Starknet, are delivering the kind of scale for blockchain we didn’t think was possible. I want to see them reach the hands of any interested developer in the world,” said Oliva. My top priority will be supporting, empowering and expanding the strong community of devs and others who are making Starknet the most lively ecosystem for building and scaling Ethereum.” 


      Starknet is a permissionless, decentralised validity rollup operating as a Layer 2 network over Ethereum, where any dApp can achieve vastly increased scale for its computation, without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security.


      The recently-formed Starknet Foundation holds 50.1% of the initial minting of 10 billion Starknet tokens. Backed by a diverse community, it will support the growth and advancement of the Starknet network and its technology. 


      Goals include promoting the use of Starknet, fostering community engagement, and facilitating project governance. The Foundation will also contribute funding and organisation for user and developer education, conferences, as well as collaborate with related communities.
