          In this episode of Empire, Jason and Santi are joined by Eli
          Ben-Sasson and Uri Kolodny to discuss Starkware and the ZK-rollup
          future. This episode is an absolute masterclass on scaling Ethereum
          using zero-knowledge proofs and a fractal architecture. 


          We discuss the limits of L1 scaling, ZK vs Optimistic rollups, native L2 programming languages, Layer 3 applications and much more!

          Circle’s USDC has quickly become one of the most trusted and widely used stablecoins because of its composability, stability and reserve transparency. As a seamless, trusted digital currency, USDC is a zero-to-one opportunity for the global financial system. Check out their Transparency Hub at circle.com/transparency that outlines everything from links to USDC weekly reserve reports, monthly attestations, and blog posts written by their executive team highlighting how and why USDC was built the way it is.
