      title: "KZG vs FRI: Polynomial Commitment Schemes Revisited"
      description: >-
        At Stanford Blockchain Conference 2023, Eli Ben Sasson made a comparison
        of two main polynomial commitment schemes (PCS) used in practice: 


        1. KZG, used in DankSharding and many a SNARK

        2. FRI, used in Stone and other STARKs. 


        This talk will revisit the topic and add Binius - a new PCS based on towers of binary fields. 


        Topics to be discussed: 

        - What is the cost of committing to data in different commitment schemes?

        - The impact of choice of finite field - large prime (KZG) vs. small prime (FRI) vs. small binary towers (Binius)

        - Additional considerations when deploying inside a SNARK, STARK or other ARKs


        Speakers:

        Eli Ben-Sasson, CEO of StarkWare

        Shahar Papini, Software Engineer at StarkWare

        Jim Posen, Co-Founder at Ulvetanna

        Zac Williamson, CEO and Co-Founder at Aztec Labs

        Mamy Ratsimbazafy, Head of Proof Systems at Taiko
