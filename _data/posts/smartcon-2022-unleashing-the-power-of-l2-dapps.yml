          How do layer-2 environments scale blockchains, and what use cases are
          unlocked by reaching global scale? In this SmartCon 2022 presentation,
          Gai Ron, product manager and blockchain researcher at StarkWare,
          explores the limitations of layer-1 dApps, the advantages of
          layer-2-native dApps, and the path forward for StarkNet.
