      The Starknet Foundation is excited to announce the formation of its Gaming
      Committee. Comprised of six experts, the Committee's mandate is to promote
      the growth of gaming on Starknet. 




      ## The Gaming Committee


      ### Role


      The Gaming Committee's role is to analyze, strategize, and recommend programs to expand Starknet's gaming ecosystem. Its success will be measured by usage metrics like daily active users, retention rates, and revenue.




      ### Overview


      Gaming is critical to driving blockchain adoption. Starknet's high performance and low cost makes it an ideal platform for next-generation games. The Committee recognizes this potential and will focus on realizing it.




      ### Membership


      Appointed by the Starknet Foundation Board, the Gaming Committee consists of:




      1. Henri Lieutaud, Starknet Foundation  


      2. Oli Freuler, Starkware

      4. Chris Lexmond, Unstoppable Games


      5. Tarrence van As, Cartridge


      6. Loaf, Loot Realms




      Their combined expertise will guide the committee in achieving its goals.




      ### Mission 


      The Committee is tasked with designing and recommending programs to incentivize developers to build games on Starknet and to incentivize players to use them.




      ## Roadmap

      \- Assess ecosystem readiness and needs


      \- Deliverable: Ecosystem analysis report 




      ### Phase 2 (Strategy)

      The Committee will meet regularly, seek feedback, and report progress to the Foundation.




      ## Budget


      50 million STRK have been earmarked to fund proposals recommended by the gaming committee.


      ## Closing Remarks


      Following the success of past committees, we believe the Gaming Committee will meaningfully expand Starknet's gaming ecosystem.
