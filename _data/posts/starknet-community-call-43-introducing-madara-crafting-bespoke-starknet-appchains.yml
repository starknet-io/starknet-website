          Built on the robust Substrate framework and fast, thanks to Rust,
          Madara delivers performance and scalability for Starknet-based
          Validity Rollup chain.


          Madara is based on substrate and uses the Cairo VM and the Blockifier to execute Cairo programs and Starknet smart contracts.

          It leverages the power of Cairo to make any program execution actually provable.

          A prover or a prover market can ultimately listen to the blocks produced by the chain and generate proofs. Thus, a madara-chain can technically settle on any L1/L2.
