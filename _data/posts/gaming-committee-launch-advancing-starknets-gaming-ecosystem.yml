      The Starknet Foundation is excited to announce the formation of its Gaming
      Committee. Comprised of six experts, the Committee's mandate is to promote
      the growth of gaming on Starknet. 


      ## The Gaming Committee


      ### Role

      Gaming is critical to driving blockchain adoption. Starknet's high performance and low cost makes it an ideal platform for next-generation games. The Committee recognizes this potential and will focus on realizing it.
