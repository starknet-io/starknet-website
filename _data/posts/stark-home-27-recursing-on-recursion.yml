        description: >-
          Recursive STARKs are now used daily to scale Ethereum, on StarkEx and
          StarkNet. 


          In this STARK @ Home StarkWare’s Shahar Papini(Cairo co-creator) and Shahar Samocha will join me as we dive into the following topics:



          What does recursive proving mean? 


          How do proving time, space, and latency change with recursive proofs? How are verification time and amortized gas cost affected by it?


          How do cryptographic building blocks and commitment schemes affect recursive proving efficiency?


          What are the limits of recursive proving?



          For more preparatory information please see our previous episode on recursion and the recent StarkNet Community Call on the topic.
