      The Starknet Foundation Ambassador Program is a unique initiative designed
      with a mission to decentralize and amplify the knowledge of Starknet on a
      global scale. 


      The objective of this program is to identify and engage with exceptional Starknet community members worldwide who are poised to bring about a significant transformation in the blockchain ecosystem.


      The ambassador program revolves around four core attributes:


      **Organizing Events -** The ambassadors are encouraged to initiate, coordinate, and execute impactful events that can boost awareness about Starknet and foster community engagement.


      **Speaking at Events -** Ambassadors can represent Starknet at local and international events, forums, and conferences, discussing the latest updates, breakthroughs, and possibilities that Starknet offers.


      **Generating Content** **\-** Ambassadors play a crucial role in creating engaging content across various platforms - blogs, podcasts, videos, and social media - to ensure Starknet’s vision and advancements reach a wider audience.


      **Grant Disbursement** **\-** Starknet ambassadors are entrusted with the responsibility of identifying and granting funds to promising, upcoming developers who are striving to make a difference in the decentralized world with their innovations.

      The onboarding committee has assigned several individuals to commence this
      journey as founding ambassadors. Each ambassador will be granted a tenure
      of three months, which is extendable based on their contribution and
      engagement.
