      ## What is StarkNet? 

      StarkNet is a cutting-edge, permissionless layer 2 network that empowers developers and users to unleash the full potential of smart contracts.Â

      One of the key features is its ability to harness the power of a supercomputer for trustless processing inside smart contracts, relying on math instead of game theory and oracles. Scalability is not just about cheap transactions but also about the number of transactions and complexity, StarkNet offers both. With StarkNet, developers no longer need to worry about gas costs for computation, it's like having a vinyl disc with unlimited capacity. This means developers now have access to significantly more computing power, opening up new use cases and possibilities. 

      Another innovative feature of StarkNet is its account abstraction, which allows users to link their assets (tokens, NFTs, identities) to a smart contract instead of a private key, providing a safer and more flexible solution. The ability to completely redefine how blockchain UI works with Account Contracts gives developers the freedom to create a more user-friendly experience. 

      StarkNet also offers a trustless bridging mechanism that relies on math instead of validators, eliminating the need for staking and slashing. This bridge allows for instant withdrawals and data transfer, making cross-chain apps easier to build. 

      Furthermore, StarkNet provides storage proofs, a cryptographic way of verifying that a value is indeed part of the state, allowing for trustless data transfer from any contract, block or blockchain. 

      Finally, StarkNet's fractal scaling and recursion technology allows for nesting proofs inside of proofs resulting in a smaller final proof, providing cost and latency benefits, and new opportunities for L3 and applicative-recursion for even better performance and cost benefits. The sky's the limit with StarkNet.
