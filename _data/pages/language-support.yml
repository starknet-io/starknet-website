      ### Starknet translation program


      The [Starknet translation program](https://starkware.crowdin.com/starknet-web) aims to make the content on starknet.io available in as many languages as possible. Please read our simple steps below for how you can contribute and help us achieve these goals:


      1. Sign up for a [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/) account (or log in if you already have one).

      2. [Select your chosen language](https://starkware.crowdin.com/starknet-web) for translation.

      3. Contribute!


      Note: Submitted translations will undergo a short review process before being published so there will be a delay before your work appears on the site.


      We also curate and maintain a list of Starknet related [communities and resources in multiple languages](/en/community/language-resources).
