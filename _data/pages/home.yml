          advanced math and cryptography, Starknet overcomes Ethereum’s
          scalability limitations. Starknet is a Validity Rollup that provides
          unlimited scale while retaining Ethereum’s security and

            description: "Starknet offers efficient and user-friendly experiences by
              employing Native Account Abstraction. All accounts are smart
              accounts: their behavior is determined by their developers rather
              than at the protocol level. This means unparalleled flexibility in
              account management. Developers can customize their applications
              beyond protocol constraints to elevate user experience and
              security.  "
