          title: Unlimited Scale
          description: Starknet utilizes the power of STARK technology to ensure
            computational integrity.   By validating off-chain transactions with
            advanced math and cryptography, Starknet overcomes Ethereum’s
            scalability limitations. Starknet is a Validity Rollup that provides
            unlimited scale while retaining Ethereum’s security and
            decentralization.

          description: "Starknet offers efficient and user-friendly experiences by
            employing Native Account Abstraction.   All accounts are smart
            accounts: their behavior is determined by their developers rather
            than at the protocol level. This means unparalleled flexibility in
            account management. Developers can customize their applications
            beyond protocol constraints to elevate user experience and
            security.  "
