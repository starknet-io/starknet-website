      The Starknet Foundation Ambassador Program is a unique initiative designed
      with a mission to decentralize and amplify the knowledge of Starknet on a
      global scale.

      **Speaking at Events -** Ambassadors can represent Starknet at local and international events, forums, and conferences, discussing the latest updates, breakthroughs, and possibilities that Starknet offers.


      **Generating Content** **\-** Ambassadors play a crucial role in creating engaging content across various platforms - blogs, podcasts, videos, and social media - to ensure Starknet’s vision and advancements reach a wider audience.


      **Grant Disbursement** **\-** Starknet ambassadors are entrusted with the responsibility of identifying and granting funds to promising, upcoming developers who are striving to make a difference in the decentralized world with their innovations.
