      Starknet is a Validity-Rollup (aka ZK-Rollup) Layer 2 network that
      operates on top of Ethereum, enabling dApps to massively scale without
      compromising on security.


      It achieves this by bundling transactions into an off-chain computed STARK proof. This proof is then submitted to Ethereum as a single transaction, resulting in significantly higher throughput, faster processing times, and much lower costs, all while retaining the robust security of the Ethereum settlement layer.

description: zk - Bankai is hosting a hacker house for serious hand-picked zk
  Builders from the Indian builder community. The house will be hosted from
  December 1 - December 7 in the coolest Web3 hub in Bangalore, Karnataka. Zo
  World (https://zo.xyz/) hosts core Web3 builders, developers and founders in
  its space.   The idea is simple, get the best people in the zk space and put
  them under one roof, see what comes out of it? zk bankai is a community of 35
  people currently, and weâ€™ll be inviting about 30 hackers IRL for the Hacker
  house.
