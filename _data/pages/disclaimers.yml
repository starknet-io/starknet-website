StarkWare shall not be responsible nor liable towards any Subject Persons or any otherperson or entity for any Applications or End User Content or for any activities performed through theNetwork.The Network may be updated or modified from time to time. Such modifications or updates may besignificant, including the adoption of new versions of the Network that differ substantially from thecurrent version and result in significant changes to the Network. Such changes may include updatesor the implementation of a more advanced version of the Network or other features of the Network.To the extent an End User wishes to upload to the Network certain End User Content or Applicationswhich shall include transaction data, such upload may be subject to certain usage limitations as maybe indicated by StarkWare from time to time, including transactions rate and total value locked.Please note that although the Network is currently not a decentralized network, in the future, weintend to change the Network to a partially decentralized network and ultimately to a fullydecentralized Network. In such case the actual existence and performance of the Network will bedependent on the collective actions of various participants in the Network. In addition, as adecentralized Network, the Network may not continue to exist and may not perform as expected ifsuch parties cease their activities on the Network. We cannot guarantee that such parties willcontinue to act or that the Network will continue to exist or perform at the expected level.StarkWare will not have any liability or responsibility with respect to any decentralized portion of theNetwork. In case a change of the Network to a decentralized network would occur, additionalchanges to these Terms may apply.The Network is currently provided free of charge. In the future, StarkWare intends to charge a fee foruse of the computing power of the Network, and you hereby agree and consent to any such futurefees. Once the Network is decentralized, the fees will be determined by the Network algorithms, orany other mechanism that will be determined by the participants in the Network.\
