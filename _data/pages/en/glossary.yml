    title: Glossary
    description: This document provides definitions for the main Starknet concepts
      and terms, along with their relationship to one another. Familiarity with
      the Starknet and Cairo is assumed.
  - type: ordered_block
    blocks:
      - title: Starknet Users
        body: The users that interact with Starknet sequencer nodes and, if necessary,
          with L1 contracts. These users, whether human or automated, are the
          agents that submit transactions to the Starknet network.
      - title: Application Developers
        body: The users of Starknet that develop Starknet applications. They write and
          deploy Starknet and Ethereum contracts.
      - title: Starknet Application
        body: A collection of contracts (L1 and L2) that collectively implement a
          business flow.
      - title: Starknet Contract
        body: >-
          The program that encodes the implemented application business logic.
          This includes the application data structures and handling of specific
          transactions sent by users. Specifically, the Starknet contract
          encodes valid state transitions for the application.


          * Starknet Account Contracts: Given account abstraction, user accounts are not implemented at the protocol level. Some contracts will, therefore, need to implement the concept of user accounts; these are called Account Contracts. The exact implementation depends on the contract; but, technically, these are Starknet contracts that are implemented in Cairo.
      - title: Starknet Transaction
        body: An invocation of a specific state-transition logic that’s defined by a
          contract. Syntactically, a transaction has a well-defined structure
          that includes all the necessary metadata and an arbitrary data
          payload. The semantics of the transaction is defined by the invoked
          contract.
      - title: Blocks (previously known as batches)
        body: >-
          Ordered sets of Starknet transactions that are run using the Starknet
          OS, resulting in one aggregated state change that is then committed to
          the Starknet L1 core contract. A block has:


          * … a block hash – a unique stable identifier that can be used to query and refer to the block.

          * … a block number – an ordinal number representing the location of the block in the sequence of accepted blocks in Starknet. Note, a block’s number may change over time. Also, a given number may refer to different blocks at different points in time, e.g., in the event of L1 chain re-orders.
      - title: Prover
        body: A separate process (either an online service or internal to the node) that
          receives the output of Cairo programs and generates STARK proofs to be
          verified. The Prover submits the STARK proof to the verifier that
          registers the fact on L1.
      - title: Starknet OS
        body: >
          Updates the L2 state of the system based on transactions that are
          received as inputs. Effectively facilitates the execution of the
          (Cairo-based) Starknet contracts. The OS is Cairo-based and is
          essentially the program whose output is proven and verified using the
          STARK-proof system. Specific system operations and functionality
          available for Starknet contracts are available as calls made to the
          OS.
      - title: Starknet State
        body: The state is composed of contracts’ code and contracts’ storage.
      - title: Starknet L1 Core Contract
        body: >-
          This L1 contract defines the state of the system by storing the
          commitment to the L2 state. The contract also stores the Starknet OS
          program hash – effectively defining the version of Starknet the
          network is running. The committed state on the L1 core contract acts
          as the consensus mechanism of Starknet, i.e., the system
          is secured by the L1 Ethereum consensus. In addition to maintaining
          the state, the Starknet L1 Core Contract is the main hub of operations
          for Starknet on L1. Specifically:


          * It stores the list of allowed verifiers (contracts) that can verify state update transactions

          * It facilitates L1 ↔ L2 interaction
      - title: Full State Node
        body: A node in the Starknet network that is used only for querying the current
          Starknet state. It can independently (i.e., without/o querying
          additional nodes) answer queries about the current state of the
          Starknet network, including the L1 state. It does not batch
          transactions or prove batches.
      - title: Starknet Sequencer Node
        body: The main node of the Starknet network. It implements the core
          functionality of sequencing transactions submitted to it. It executes
          the Starknet OS Cairo program with the relevant inputs, proves the
          result using the Proving Service or some internal STARK prover, and
          eventually updates the network state on the Starknet Core Contract.
