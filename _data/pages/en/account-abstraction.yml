      ## Section 1


      StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as a “ZK-Rollup”). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation –  without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security, thanks to StarkNet’s reliance on the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof system – [STARK](https://starkware.co/stark/).


      StarkNet Contracts and the StarkNet OS are written in Cairo – supporting the deployment and scaling of any use case, whatever the business logic. Your use of the StarkNet Alpha is under [these](https://starknet.io/starknet-terms-of-use/) terms of use.
