      Cairo is a Turing-complete programming language designed to make writing
      STARK-provable programs efficient, safe, and easy. Developed in 2020,
      Cairo empowers developers to build Layer-2 applications that can be
      securely executed off-chain and settled on Ethereum with the mathematical
      integrity guaranteed by STARK proofs. 


      Using Cairo, developers can write code that is strongly typed, with ownership and borrowing, which helps make programs more secure. It also supports Sierra, a new intermediate representation that ensures every Cairo run can be proven. This makes Cairo particularly well-suited for use in a permissionless network like StarkNet, where it can provide robust DoS protection and censorship resistance.


      Cairo has quickly become one of the most popular programming languages in the blockchain space. It has been used to handle over $790 billion worth of trades, process over 300 million transactions and mint more than 90 million NFTs. With the release of Cairo 1.0, we aim to make the language even more accessible and user-friendly while also introducing new features that enhance safety and convenience.


      Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced programmer, Cairo provides the tools you need to create powerful and secure Layer-2 applications. Get started today and join the revolution as we scale Ethereum to meet global demand!
