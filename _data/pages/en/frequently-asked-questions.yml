        label: What will the StarkNet tokens be used for?
        body: The Starknet token will be used for paying transaction fees, participation
          in the Starknet protocol, and participation in governance. The
          rationale for each of these utilities is presented in our
          [decentralization
          proposal](https://medium.com/starkware/part-2-a-decentralization-and-governance-proposal-for-starknet-23e335645778),
          in the section titled “What will the tokens be used for?”

        label: Where Can I Monitor Starknet’s Transactions?
        body: "There are several block explorers you can use:
          [StarkScan](https://starkscan.co/),
          [Voyager](https://voyager.online/txns),
          [ViewBlock](https://viewblock.io/starknet)."

        label: I Want to Write my own Contract on Starknet. Where do I Start? Are there
          any Available Toolkits?
        body: >-
          A good place to start is the [Hello Starknet
          tutorial](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/), which guides the
          developer step by step through writing and deploying a simple
          contract. The [Starknet
          Playground](https://starknet.io/playground/?lesson=starknet_contract)
          offers an environment for learning how to write Starknet contracts and
          test them. 


          You can become part of the developers’ community, and support it, by joining the [Starknet Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QypNMzkHbc) server.

        body: SHARP (shared prover) is a service for computing proofs of the correct
          execution of Cairo programs. It can be used to prove the correct
          execution of a particular Cairo program which enforces the validity of
          Starknet state transitions – the Starknet OS (operating system).
          Currently, Starknet uses SHARP alongside many other customers to
          amortize proof costs. In the future, Starknet throughput may justify a
          dedicated prover layer..
        label: How is Starknet Related to SHARP?

        label: In Starknet, are STARK Proofs Zero-Knowledge Proofs?
        body: >-
          Currently not. STARKs are defined as Validity proofs, meaning they
          prove computational integrity. With Validity proofs (STARKs included),
          one party can prove to another that a certain computation was
          performed correctly. Zero-Knowledge is an additional property
          asserting that the prover does not have to reveal any information
          included in the computation.


          Most ZK-Rollups are not really Zero-Knowledge. The mistake comes from the confusion between Validity proofs (assures computational integrity) and Zero-Knowledge proofs (assures no information is revealed).


          Starknet uses STARK Validity proofs. It is worth noting that extracting information from the proof is extremely hard – almost impossible in practice.

        label: Can I Maintain Privacy on Starknet?
        body: >-
          Currently, Starknet transactions and their payloads are visible to the
          network in the same way that they are visible on Ethereum.


          It is possible to deploy various privacy protocols on Starknet, which will offer full privacy from all network participants. Since those protocols usually require a lot of computation, they will benefit greatly from Starknet scalability.

        label: What is Cairo?
        body: Cairo is an overloaded term which stands for three different things.
          First, Cairo is a CPU architecture. Second, “Cairo” is shorthand for
          CPU AIR which is an algebraic representation of this CPU architecture.
          Lastly, Cairo is a Turing complete programming language that enables
          blockchain developers to harness the power of STARKs. The first two
          aspects, alongside the instruction set of the language, are outlined
          in the [whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1063). For the
          language, see the [github
          repo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo).

        label: What is STARK?
        body: STARK is a proof system. It uses cutting-edge cryptography to provide
          polylogarithmic verification complexity and proof size, quasilinear
          proof complexity, and minimal assumptions which are
          post-quantum-secure. More information
          [here](https://starkware.co/stark/).

        label: What Is the Difference between Starknet Contracts and Cairo Programs?
        body: >-
          [Cairo](https://medium.com/starkware/hello-cairo-3cb43b13b209) is a
          Turing-complete language designed for succinctly proving the correct
          execution of Cairo programs. A Cairo program is stateless, meaning you
          do not have native access to storage, other Cairo programs, or the L1
          state (although you can access those, as explained below). 


          Starknet contracts, on the other hand, live in the Starknet VM, which has a persistent state that smart contracts can access and modify. These smart contracts can store variables, communicate with other contracts, and send/receive messages to/from L1 ([read more](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html)).

        label: Do I Have to Write My Contract in Cairo to Deploy on Starknet?
        body: >-
          No. You have several options for writing a contract, each with its own
          benefits. 


          Cairo is the native language for a Starknet contract, which most fully realizes the scaling potential of Starknet. On the other hand, several teams are developing transpilers from other programming languages (notably Solidity) to Cairo. Such transpilers facilitate quick deployment of existing contracts on Starknet.**[See our latest development tooling](/developers/tools-resources).**
