    body: StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as
      a “ZK-Rollup”). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any
      dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation – without compromising
      Ethereum’s composability and security, thanks to StarkNet’s reliance on
      the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof system – STARK. StarkNet
      Contracts and the StarkNet OS are written in Cairo – supporting the
      deployment and scaling of any use case, whatever the business logic.
