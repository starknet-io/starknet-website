      ### How does it scale Ethereum?


      Starknet sits on top of Ethereum as a layer 2 network. It uses technology called “STARK Proofs” to securely compress huge amounts of transactions for Ethereum.

      ### What are wallets?


      StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (often referred to as ZK-Rollup). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation – without compromising Ethereum's composability and security.

          We continue to work on two parallel vectors:


          1. Evolve Cairo 1.0 at full speed towards full-feature compatibility with the old Cairo.

          2. Develop Starknet v0.11.0 that will support contracts written in Cairo 1.0


          In the meanwhile, we encourage devs to start writing with Cairo 1.0 and getting familiar with it.

        content: We are happy to announce a new StarkNet Sequencer is in the works. As
          StarkNet’s tech stack moves towards open-source, following [Cairo
          1.0](https://medium.com/starkware/open-sourcing-cairo-1-0-b3100a664bb0) and [Papyrus
          Full
          Node](https://medium.com/starkware/papyrus-an-open-source-starknet-full-node-396f7cd90202),
          we now continue with StarkNet’s new sequencer. It will be open-source,
          available under Apache 2.0 license, and you can go check out [the
          repo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier) now!
