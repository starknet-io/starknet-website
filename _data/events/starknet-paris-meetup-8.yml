description: Nearly 300 of you registered for our last meetup at the Crowne
  Plaza back in March.  For the April meetup, we're lucky to have access to the
  facilities of Dauphine, who have lent us a very large room with a capacity of
  over 200 people. Join us to talk about ZK-Rollups, the latest news on
  Starknet, ongoing projects, and to meet the OGs of the ecosystem!
