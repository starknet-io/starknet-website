type: meetup
name: Cairo Exploration Gathering in Tokyo
description: This event is about bringing your PC and trying out Cairo! We are
  incorporating the self-study style that received positive feedback at the
  Starknet Tokyo Meetup.  While having a PC is essential, we are planning to
  provide tutorials and resources for interacting with Cairo, even if you have
  no prior development experience. Beginners are warmly welcome!  In the end,
  we've also set aside time for networking. Let's make the most of building and
  communicating.  *Please note that there may be promotional photography during
  the event. *We will not provide any investment advice.
