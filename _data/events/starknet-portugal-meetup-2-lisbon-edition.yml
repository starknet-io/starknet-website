description: We are back again, this time in Lisbon! After the success of the
  first edition in Porto, on the 15th of March, Lisbon felt like the obvious
  place for a new round, with ETHGlobal Lisbon right around the corner.  So come
  and join us on Tuesday, May 9th 2023 between 18:30 and 21:00 GMT for the 2nd
  edition of the Starknet Meetup in Portugal to talk about ZK-Rollups, Starknet
  news, current projects that are being built and all kinds of coolness.
